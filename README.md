They might require a **valid voms proxy** for accessing input data.

git clone --recursive git@github.com:uhh-cms/topmass.git
cd topmass

# source the setup and store decisions in .setups/dev.sh (arbitrary name)
source setup.sh dev

# index existing tasks once to enable auto-completion for "law run"
law index --verbose

# run your first task
# tba
```
